Our team at NoviceDock has put together a few of our branding assets to be used in any publications.

# Fonts

## Logo
Our logo uses a Google Web Font called Ramaraja

## Text
All text on NoviceDock, aside from the logo (and a few miscellaneous parts) is a combination of Nunito and Nunito Sans. We commonly use Nunito Sans for headings, and Nunito for paragraphs.

# Colors

**Primary Color:** #2a324b

**Accent Color:** #e4be9e

We often change the shade of the accent color depending if it is on a white background, or the primary color background.

# Assets

We currently provide three logo assets for publications. Variations of sizes can be founded in the [Company Assets](Assets/Company) folder. We recommend using our main logo and not the transparent one.
