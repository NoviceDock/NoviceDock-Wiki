Our team at NoviceDock has put together a few of our branding assets to be used in any publications.

# Fonts

## Logo
![NoviceDock Logo](/Assets/Company/logo-main/novicedock-512w.png)

Our logo uses a Google Web Font called Ramaraja

## Text
All text on NoviceDock, aside from the logo (and a few miscellaneous parts) is a combination of [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans). We commonly use Nunito Sans for headings, and Nunito for paragraphs.

# Colors

### Primary Color

### Accent Color

#e4be9e

We often change the shade of the accent color depending if it is on a white background, or the primary color background.

# Assets

We currently provide three logo assets for publications. Variations of sizes can be founded in the [Company Assets](Assets/Company) folder. We recommend using our main logo and not the transparent one.

None of these may be altered. If you choose to reference NoviceDock, it must have a capital N and capital D, and as one word put together

### Main
![NoviceDock Logo](/Assets/Company/logo-main/novicedock-512w.png)

We prefer the main version of the logo be used by any publication.

### Transparent

If for some reason the background you are placing our logo on does not work with the main, feel free to use the transparent logo. Use only on light backgrounds!

### Thumbnail

If you need a square version of the logo, use this.
