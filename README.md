# NoviceDock Wiki
A large part of NoviceDock is the community behind it. We want to help give direction to thousands of new learners, but we can't always do it alone. We love contributions, not only does it help us, but dozens of other niches that need education to thrive.

We care about communication, so we check our messages **daily**. If you have any questions, or want to say hello, reach out us personally at hello@novicedock.com.

#### Steps to Writing a Syllabus
1. Contact hello@novicedock.com with your syllabus idea. It does not have to fall into our current categories, but that would be preferred.
2. If we agree, we'll set up a shared preformatted Google Doc that the syllabus will be written in.
3. Read [How to Write a NoviceDock Syllabus](https://github.com/NoviceDock/NoviceDock-Wiki/blob/master/How_To_Write_a_Syllabus.md). Writing a syllabus is slightly different than directly teaching, so it's important to understand how to write one. 
4. Check out some of our other syllabi!
5. Write
6. Provide us with your name, bio, photo (optional), and any links you want to promote for yourself.

### Submit a Resource
Once a syllabus is posted, we don't like to stop there. Information is constantly changing and new better resources are always becoming available. 

Did you build a good resource? Tell us! You don't need to hide that you created it, we don't judge. We judge solely on the quality of the content, so self-promotion is okay.
