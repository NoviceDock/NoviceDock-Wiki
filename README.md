# NoviceDock Wiki
A large part of NoviceDock is the community behind it. We want to help give direction to thousands of new learners, but we can't always do it alone. We love contributions, not only does it help us, but dozens of other niches that need education to thrive.

We care about communication, so we check our messages **daily**. If you have any questions, or want to say hello, reach out us personally at hello@novicedock.com.
