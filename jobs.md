This page is specifically meant for those who are interested in joining the NoviceDock team. If you would like to write a syllabus or suggest a resource, please check out the [Contribute](https://github.com/NoviceDock/NoviceDock-Wiki#contribute) section of the wiki homepage.

We are currently in the beginning phase of NoviceDock. We launched in late August of 2017 and our main focus has been learning about our audience, product development, and content creation.

If you would like to help out, you can see areas where you can join below. If the project ends up being successful (generates profit beyond), you would obviously end up being rewarded. Currently, any money we currently make goes right back into content creation. We feel it is too early to focus on monetization.

If you are interested, look at the departments below, and send me an email at brad@novicedock.com. I will get back to you within 24 hours.

## Departments

### Marketing
We love storytelling. If you'd like to improve your storytelling skills this would certainly be an area you want to join. 

### Outreach
Help NoviceDock communicate with current partners, and search for other strategic partnerships.

### Development
Our website is built with a completely custom WordPress theme. As we learn about our audience, we fix parts of our website and add features to enhance the overall user experience. 

If you are not too much of a coder, we'd also love for someone to help out with design.
