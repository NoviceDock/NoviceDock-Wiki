# How to Write a NoviceDock Syllabus

_Written by Bradley Mitchell_

First, understand NoviceDock is not Udemy, not Khan Academy, not Coursera, not an online course platform. Udemy is fantastic for knowing exactly what you want to learn, and then finding an online video course to start or expand your knowledge. More specifically, it’s meant for a **single phase** of learning a specific topic. Once you finish that video course, you are on your own, often asking, what’s next?

## How is a syllabus different from a course?

NoviceDock is meant for building syllabi with resources. A syllabus is vastly different from an actual course. Normally, you imagine a syllabus as a listing of concepts that you are going to learn (over the next week, month, year, etc). Think of a syllabus on NoviceDock as an extended, detailed and long-term version of a normal syllabus, with resources. 

Our full detailed syllabus is what gives meaning to the resources. Don’t have only top Google Searches for resources, you also want to find the hidden gems praised by the community. 
We recommend starting out with some resources, and writing the syllabus around them. **In a perfect scenario 50% of your efforts should be on the syllabus, and the other 50% on resources.** NoviceDock is meant to be resource-oriented. 

## What, How, Why

Let’s say I’m a developer, and I go read the documentation for a programming language framework called Django. It will tell me what it is how to use it, **step by step**.

Each section on NoviceDock should start by answering "What is this?". 

After explaining what it is, **it's not necessary to do the job of your resources**. You don't need to go writing a step-by-step guide.

Rather, considering answering questions such as:
 
* “What major companies use Django today?”
* “What are the different applications of Django?”
* “Is Django popular in the development world?”
* “How does it compare to other frameworks on the market?”
* “Why did you choose it?”

That last question is important. Show your passion for the topic first-hand by talking about your experience with it. It makes the whole syllabus feel a lot more human.

Along with answering the what and how, it’s also important to answer why. That’s the most common question of any student. Why am I learning this? This is a question that you want to answer in every part of the syllabus. The next section will break down why even further, as it is one of the most important aspects of a syllabus.

# Storytelling

Learning is a journey, and each section should be a vital part of the journey. Reading any type of documentation can be extremely dry. We want the readers at NoviceDock to feel like they are part of a movement, and that they truly belong in the [insert-syllabus-topic] community. Remember, you are their guide and mentor!

One of our best examples of a syllabus with good story telling is our [Intro to Marketing](https://novicedock.com/learn/business/intro-to-marketing). We highly recommend that you read it before writing.

## Providing Context

Let’s say I have a final exam in one week. The entire semester I’ve skipped classes. How are you going to organize this content so I know exactly how my time should be invested? The solution is to organize content in a hierarchy.

## Content Hierarchy

When a student sees a plethora of terminology they are unaware of, it’s difficult to connect all the pieces. An important part of a NoviceDock syllabus is utilizing sections and sub-sections. For example, you are reading in the “Storytelling” section of this document, and this is the “Content Hierarchy” subsection.
Utilize subsections, A LOT. Not only do they provide clarity, but also make ingesting content much easier. Use them efficiently by staying on topic within subsections, and make sure their titles are descriptive.

The Google Doc we provide you when starting will also help you understand the format.

## Setting the Stage

Give some background on the section, a small history lesson perhaps. What was the intended use when it was created? Has that changed?

## Answering Why

The best piece of information a syllabus can provide is why. Why is this section part of the syllabus. And why is it placed where it is. How does it connect to the rest of the syllabus. Transitioning well from one paragraph to the next, or one section to the next, is extremely important.

## Bad Example

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and to trade it you must do 

1.) make an account,

2.)

That type of information is helpful, but it is mainly the job of the resources to do that. On the NoviceDock platform you will write from a different, higher level perspective. 

That being said, it is okay to go into specific detail when it helps provide context and clarity to the entire syllabus.

# Before Writing
## Community Input

Before dumping everything in your brain onto paper, reach out to the community. Reddit is often the best place to start. Make a list of section titles and ask the community if they agree, or see anything to add. 

When you make a list of section titles, feel free to reach back out to us at hello@novicedock.com. We will try to help!

## Read Other Syllabi

NoviceDock already has a lot of syllabi up on the website. Read through a few. We recommend [Ethereum](https://novicedock.com/learn/cryptocurrency/ethereum) and [Intro to Marketing](https://novicedock.com/learn/business/intro-to-marketing). It may help you understand the perspective and structure that you should aim for. 

# Specifications

We did not want to add too many requirements as we do not want to inhibit creativity. That being said, there are a few necessary components that need to be included in every NoviceDock syllabus.

## Introduction

This is the first section in every NoviceDock syllabus. You can use it as a tool to introduce your topic. It can be helpful to talk about the general layout of your syllabus too! For example,
“This Computer Architecture syllabus will first focus on the C programming language, which is a lower level language. From there it will move into Assembly programming language, and finally Digital Circuits.”

## Prerequisites

This is the section immediately after the introduction. What level of difficulty is it this syllabus? Is there anything required to study before approaching this topic? You can provide resources in this section to go learn the prerequisites as well.

If this is a beginner syllabus, it's okay to say there are no prerequisites.

## Last Sections

This is dependent on the syllabus, but we recommend the last section talk about how to. Remember your reader is essentially now leaving the nest to go out on their own. How do you recommend they do it?

Your last section or last few sections should talk about personal advice, good communities to get involved in, and the job market for the topic. Preferably all those three.. You can split them into multiple sections if needed.

## Author

You will notice that every syllabus on NoviceDock includes a decent amount of information on the author. This means when submitting your syllabus you will need to provide your name, a picture of you, a short bio, and links you want to share (social media profiles or promotions for your work).

## Length
There's no specific requirement for how many sections are necessary. The sweet spot is usually between 7-12 sections. Each section should have at least a couple of paragraphs (about 3-5 sentences). Use the existing syllabi to help judge. 

As for resources, each section should have anywhere from 3-10+ resources. The sweet spot being around 5-7. Each resource should have a sentence or two for the description.

# After Publishing

NoviceDock is still in early stages with little resources. We would love to stay in touch afterwards via [email](hello@novicedock.com), [Telegram](https://t.me/novicedock), or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoviceDock/). Information is constantly changing, and if you feel you need to make updates to your syllabus, we can easily have that arranged.
