# Introduction

You find something new you want to learn. At first, the rush is exciting, there's so many great and fun resources that provide you the tools to start off. 

Then time goes on. 

You run out of tutorials that hold your hand and tell you where to go. The beginner exercises aren't challenging enough. You feel lost when navigating on your own.

**That's why we built NoviceDock.**

NoviceDock is an online education platform. We make long-term syllabi (plural for syllabus), that give you a straightforward path to follow when learning a new topic. Each section of a syllabus has a detailed summary (answering what it is and why you should learn it), and tons of good resource to go learn. 

We'll start you out at the beginner stage, and move past that into the interemediate and expert stages, all the while providing you direction, and the resources you need to succeed.
